# Internal Pipe Corrosion Assessment with Ultrasound and CNNs

This study introduces a dual-mode methodology for quantifying pipe corrosion by employing ultrasound technology in conjunction with convolutional neural networks (CNN).

## Overview

#### Components

-   **Data Handling**: `data.py` includes functions for loading datasets.
-   **EDA**: `EDA/plot.py` for data visualization.
-   **Models**: Various CNN architectures in the `model` directory.
-   **Preprocessing**: Scripts in `preprocess` folder for data preparation.
-   **Utilities**: Functions in `utils.py` for common tasks.
-   **Results**: TensorBoard logs are stored in the `result` directory.

#### Usage

-   Execute `main.py` to run main project functionalities.
-   Use functions from `utils.py` for additional tasks.
-   Data loading functions are implemented in `data.py`.

This README provides a concise overview of the project structure and its key components.
